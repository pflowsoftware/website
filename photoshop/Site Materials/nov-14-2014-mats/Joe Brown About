My name is Joe Brown. I love intensification and interactivity. I write code and I make electronics because there is always room for more powerful and intuitive interaction. I don't tinker and solder and learn programming languages for the joy of learning. I work on projects because I care about the results. My work in Gravity Current is the realization of a life-long goal. I am here to create and share an ability to become a master of both light and sound, music and geometry, fractals and physical models; through whatever instrument you may play. We have the ability to control so much more with a voice or an intrument. The only missing piece is a couple thousand lines of code.
